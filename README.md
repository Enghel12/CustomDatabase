# This is a program made in C++ that acts as a custom database.

This software simulates the functionality of a database, incorporating fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
The primary objective of this project was to innovate a database system for local usage.

## How it works

The user can create, read, update or delete the data inside the tables, the databases are represented by notepad files(each database is a notepad file). The stored data will be
represented by strings.
All in all, this program was created to serve as a custom database for the user and to have some features (such as the rating feature) that other databases like MySql do not have.

## Upcomming features
A unique feature that will be added soon is that the program will have a class that reviews the data stored inside each database and gives it a rating. 
If there are many problems with the data that is stored, the rating will go down, if the data does not have any issue, the rating will increase and the user 
will be informed about any issues regarding the data at each execution of the program.
