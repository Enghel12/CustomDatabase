This is a program made in C++ that acts as a custom database. By using the program, the user can create or delete databases, the databases being represented by notepad files
(each database is a notepad file). The user can also create, read, update or delete the data inside tables, data which is represented by strings. 
A unique feature that will be added soon is that the program will have a class that reviews the data stored inside each database and gives it a rating. 
If there are many problems with the data that is stored, the rating will go down, if the data does not have any issue, the rating will increase and the user will be informed 
about any issues regarding the data at each execution of the program.

All in all, this program was created to serve as a custom database for the user and to have some features (such as the rating feature) that other databases like MySql do not have.
